Here is some suggested content for the README file to document this countdown timer project:

# Countdown Timer

This is a simple countdown timer that displays the remaining time until a set date. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Displays remaining days, hours, minutes and seconds 
- Timer persists on page reload using localStorage
- Clean UI with minimal styling

## Usage

The countdown target date is currently hardcoded in the JavaScript, and can be easily changed by modifying the `countDownDate` variable:

```js
// Set count down date
let countDownDate = new Date();
countDownDate.setDate(countDownDate.getDate() + 5); // 5 days from now
```

When the page loads, the script checks localStorage for an existing end date. If none is found, it sets the target date and stores in localStorage.

The `setInterval()` function calls the display update every second, recalculating the time units and updating the DOM. It also updates localStorage on each pass to keep the end date persistent.

## Customizing

The styling can be customized by editing the CSS in `styles.css`. Things like color, spacing, fonts, etc can be changed.

The target date can be set to any future date. Just update the `countDownDate` variable in the JavaScript.

For more significant changes, edit the HTML structure or JavaScript logic. The time units can be displayed in a different order, additional units like weeks can be added, and calculations can be tweaked as needed.
